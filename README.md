# AIML-Linear-Regression
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities.

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `Housing.csv`
- Columns: `price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, furnishingstatus`

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Handled missing values (if any).
3. Encoded categorical columns using Label Encoding.
4. Selected relevant features.
5. Split the data into training and testing sets.
6. Trained a Linear Regression model.
7. Evaluated the model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error.

## 🔧 Libraries Used
```python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 📊 Results

- **R² Score**: *0.6495*
- **Mean Squared Error**: *1771751116594.03*
